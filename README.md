# 🩺 Diabetes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on a diabetes dataset to uncover hidden patterns, visualize trends, and extract meaningful insights that may support **medical research and predictive modeling**.  

The notebook covers:  
- 🧹 Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- 📊 Statistical & feature analysis  
- 🔗 Correlation studies  
- 📈 Visualizations (distributions, pairplots, heatmaps, etc.)  
- 💡 Key insights and observations  

The ultimate goal is to understand the dataset better and highlight patterns that could guide **healthcare decision-making**.  

---

## 📊 Objectives
- Analyze the distribution of medical features (glucose levels, BMI, etc.).  
- Identify correlations between health indicators.  
- Detect and handle outliers.  
- Summarize patterns relevant to diabetes prediction models.  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive exploration  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
1. Certain features (e.g., glucose levels, BMI) strongly correlate with diabetes outcomes.  
2. Outliers significantly affect statistical summaries and visualizations.  
3. Not all features contribute equally — some have limited predictive power.  
4. Correlation heatmaps highlight relationships between medical features.
